Upgrade notes
#############

To resolve numerous security flaws, the nginx package was updated to 1.10.x.

You should review your configuration files in /etc/nginx to determine if there
are any incompatibilities. Below is a summary of the main incompatible changes.
Some nginx directives have been changed or removed, so you may need to modify
your configuration.

Please see upstream release notes for a complete list of new features,
bug fixes, and changes: http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES-1.10
One notable feature is support for HTTP/2.

Nginx gained support for dynamic modules. As part of this update, dynamic
modules have been split into subpackages. For the time being these are hard
dependencies to aid the upgrade path. When you install nginx, all of these
modules are installed and enabled by default:
  - nginx-mod-http-geoip
  - nginx-mod-http-image-filter
  - nginx-mod-http-perl
  - nginx-mod-http-xslt-filter
  - nginx-mod-mail
  - nginx-mod-stream

Changes with nginx 1.10.x

    *) Change: non-idempotent requests (POST, LOCK, PATCH) are no longer
       passed to the next server by default if a request has been sent to a
       backend; the "non_idempotent" parameter of the "proxy_next_upstream"
       directive explicitly allows retrying such requests.

    *) Change: now the "output_buffers" directive uses two buffers by
       default.

    *) Change: now nginx limits subrequests recursion, not simultaneous
       subrequests.

    *) Change: now nginx checks the whole cache key when returning a
       response from cache.
       Thanks to Gena Makhomed and Sergey Brester.

    *) Change: the "proxy_downstream_buffer" and "proxy_upstream_buffer"
       directives of the stream module are replaced with the
       "proxy_buffer_size" directive.

    *) Change: duplicate "http", "mail", and "stream" blocks are now
       disallowed.

    *) Change: now SSLv3 protocol is disabled by default.

    *) Change: some long deprecated directives are not supported anymore.

    *) Change: obsolete aio and rtsig event methods have been removed.

Changes with nginx 1.8.x

    *) Change: the "sendfile" parameter of the "aio" directive is
       deprecated; now nginx automatically uses AIO to pre-load data for
       sendfile if both "aio" and "sendfile" directives are used.

    *) Change: now the "If-Modified-Since", "If-Range", etc. client request
       header lines are passed to a backend while caching if nginx knows in
       advance that the response will not be cached (e.g., when using
       proxy_cache_min_uses).

    *) Change: now after proxy_cache_lock_timeout nginx sends a request to a
       backend with caching disabled; the new directives
       "proxy_cache_lock_age", "fastcgi_cache_lock_age",
       "scgi_cache_lock_age", and "uwsgi_cache_lock_age" specify a time
       after which the lock will be released and another attempt to cache a
       response will be made.

    *) Change: the "log_format" directive can now be used only at http
       level.

    *) Change: now nginx takes into account the "Vary" header line in a
       backend response while caching.

    *) Change: the deprecated "limit_zone" directive is not supported
       anymore.

    *) Change: now the "stub_status" directive does not require a parameter.

    *) Change: URI escaping now uses uppercase hexadecimal digits.
       Thanks to Piotr Sikora.

Changes with nginx 1.6.x

    *) Change: improved hash table handling; the default values of the
       "variables_hash_max_size" and "types_hash_bucket_size" were changed
       to 1024 and 64 respectively.

    *) Change: now nginx expects escaped URIs in "X-Accel-Redirect" headers.

    *) Change: a logging level of auth_basic errors about no user/password
       provided has been lowered from "error" to "info".

    *) Change: now nginx assumes HTTP/1.0 by default if it is not able to
       detect protocol reliably.

    *) Change: the "js" extension MIME type has been changed to
       "application/javascript"; default value of the "charset_types"
       directive was changed accordingly.

    *) Change: now the "image_filter" directive with the "size" parameter
       returns responses with the "application/json" MIME type.

    *) Change in internal API: now u->length defaults to -1 if working with
       backends in unbuffered mode.

    *) Change: now after receiving an incomplete response from a backend
       server nginx tries to send an available part of the response to a
       client, and then closes client connection.

Changes with nginx 1.4.x

    *) Change: opening and closing a connection without sending any data in
       it is no longer logged to access_log with error code 400.

    *) Change: a compiler with name "cc" is now used by default.

    *) Change: domain names specified in configuration file are now resolved
       to IPv6 addresses as well as IPv4 ones.

    *) Change: now if the "include" directive with mask is used on Unix
       systems, included files are sorted in alphabetical order.

    *) Change: the "add_header" directive adds headers to 201 responses.

    *) Change: the ngx_http_mp4_module module no longer skips tracks in
       formats other than H.264 and AAC.

    *) Change: the "ipv6only" parameter is now turned on by default for
       listening IPv6 sockets.

    *) Change: the "single" parameter of the "keepalive" directive is now
       ignored.

    *) Change: SSL compression is now disabled when using all versions of
       OpenSSL, including ones prior to 1.0.0.

Changes with nginx 1.2.x

    *) Change: now if the "include" directive with mask is used on Unix
       systems, included files are sorted in alphabetical order.

    *) Change: the "add_header" directive adds headers to 201 responses.

    *) Change: the "single" parameter of the "keepalive" directive is now
       ignored.

    *) Change: SSL compression is now disabled when using all versions of
       OpenSSL, including ones prior to 1.0.0.

    *) Change: keepalive connections are no longer disabled for Safari by
       default.

    *) Change: the simultaneous subrequest limit has been raised to 200.

    *) Change: a "proxy_pass" directive without URI part now uses changed
       URI after redirection with the "error_page" directive.
       Thanks to Lanshun Zhou.

    *) Change: now double quotes are encoded in an "echo" SSI-command
       output.
       Thanks to Zaur Abasmirzoev.

    *) Change: the ngx_http_limit_zone_module was renamed to the
       ngx_http_limit_conn_module.

    *) Change: the "limit_zone" directive was superseded by the
       "limit_conn_zone" directive with a new syntax.

    *) Change in internal API: now module context data are cleared while
       internal redirect to named location.
       Requested by Yichun Zhang.

    *) Change: if a server in an upstream failed, only one request will be
       sent to it after fail_timeout; the server will be considered alive if
       it will successfully respond to the request.

    *) Change: now the 0x7F-0x1F characters are escaped as \xXX in an
       access_log.

    *) Change: now if total size of all ranges is greater than source
       response size, then nginx disables ranges and returns just the source
       response.

    *) Change: now cache loader processes either as many files as specified
       by "loader_files" parameter or works no longer than time specified by
       the "loader_threshold" parameter during each iteration.

    *) Change: now SIGWINCH signal works only in daemon mode.
